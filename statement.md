THE STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM IS :
Managing daily tasks can be challenging for students, professionals, and individuals who want to stay organized. Many people forget important activities because they do not maintain a proper list of tasks. 
Although digital task managers exist, beginners learning programming need a simple yet effective way to understand how such systems work internally.
To address this issue, this project aims to develop a Command-Line Based To-Do List Application using Python.
The application allows users to:
View all their tasks
Add new tasks
Delete completed or unwanted tasks
Save tasks permanently in a file
Automatically load previously saved tasks
The project demonstrates basic concepts of file handling, lists, loops, conditional statements, and user interaction in Python. It is simple enough for first-year students while still being a practical solution to everyday task management.
